# My ideas about the project of this course. All of them are based on Gaussian process models.

1. As we have known, the main problem in applying GP models is the complexity which is cubic in the number of observations N. I would like to use random Fourier features to approximate covariance function of Gaussian process, which could reduce the complexity to linear with respect to N.

2.
